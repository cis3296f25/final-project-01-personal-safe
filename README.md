# Personal Password Safe
“Personal Safe” password manager will be developed as a lightweight application to securely store and manage passwords. It will allow users to create a master account, then add, retrieve, and organize all their login credentials, which will all be encrypted and decrypted locally on their own personal device. There are plenty of password managers like LastPass and 1Password, but unlike “Personal Safe”, many of them rely on cloud storage which introduces risks if their servers are compromised. This project is different because all encryption happens on the client side, meaning data never leaves the user’s device in a plain form. The intended users are everyday people who want better security or people who are just serious about their privacy. Ultimately, this project will provide a security tool for users wanting to protect their passwords.
